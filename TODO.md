# TODOs

### Structure / layout

* Button to go back to the course page you came from.
  Use minimal breadcrumbs.
* Check out custom 404 page not showing.
* Add sample page with maximum use of the recipe layout.
* Add a contributing page with an explanation on how to use it.
  Also sane for future me.
* Add a template for the recipes.
* Bullet list with the same accent color of fancy lists.
* Multi language support.
* Additional ingredient lists.
* Optional key in main ingredient list.

##### Done
